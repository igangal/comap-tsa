# Modeling TSA Security Checkpoints
A Monte Carlo Simulation that models average wait times at TSA checkpoints. <br>
Created during the 2017 COMAP Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling by Isha Gangal, Annie Zhang, Jeffrey Song. <br>

This model is based on basic tenets of queueing theory and utilizes the Monte Carlo Method.  Allows random generation of variables and a linear progression of individually simulated passengers through each zone of security. This type of queueing model was chosen because it most accurately simulated an individualâ€™s progress through the stages of the security checkpoint and compounded wait times to show the effect of increasing the number of passengers with constant general officer/agent response capability. Based on a simulation created in Microsoft Excel by Dr. Krzysztof Fleszar.
